# Please Consider Contributing Directly to PCSX2 Instead!

The re-recording tools have been merged into PCSX2 for quite some time so it would be
preferred to make a pull-request with your change directly to [PCSX2's main repository](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2)

With that said, it does unfortunately sometimes take some time to get things merged into
PCSX2, and that may mean that substantial changes are sitting in this fork, waiting to be merged.

Depending on your changes, this might make upstream PCSX2 a bad place to start working on your changes, if you must base your work off this fork keep in mind that you will likely need to wait until things are synced up in the upstream repository before your changes can be PR'd and effectively reviewed.
