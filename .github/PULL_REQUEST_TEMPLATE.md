### Recommended PR Guidelines
The following is a list of _general_ style recommendations that will make reviewing and merging easier:
- Commit Messages
  - Please try to prefix your commit message, indicating what area of the project was modified.
    - For example `gsdx: message...`.
    - Looking at the project's commit history will help with keeping prefixes consistent overtime, there is no strictly enforced list.
  - Try to keep messages brief and informative
  - Remove unnecessary commits and squash commits together when appropriate.
    - If you are not familiar with rebasing, check out the following resources:
      - CLI - https://thoughtbot.com/blog/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history
      - GUI (SourceTree) - https://www.atlassian.com/blog/sourcetree/interactive-rebase-sourcetree
- Code Styling and Formatting
  - Consult the style guide - https://github.com/tadanokojin/pcsx2/blob/coding-guide/pcsx2/Docs/Coding_Guidelines.md
  - Run `clang-format` using the configuration file in the root of the repository
    - Visual Studio Setup - https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clangformat-support-in-visual-studio-2017-15-7-preview-1/
    - IMPORTANT - if you are running `clang-format` on unrelated changes (ie. formatting an entire file), please do so in a separate commit.
