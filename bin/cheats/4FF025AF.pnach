// This is about changing the stack pointer
// Shoves a MIPS instruction into near the very top of the entry point
// Ghidra blows up here, but binary ninja can handle it
// Orginally at this position there is `2D E8 40 00` - `daddu $sp, $v0, $zero`
// This changes it to - `lui sp, 0x0800` Which loads the value 0x0800 to the stackpointer register, modifying it.
